* orderdb
* rabbitmq
* basketdb
2. set as startup projects both basket and order, then setup ports and hope page from projects properties.

### To run only in containers

2. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up â€“d
```
3. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:
* **RabbitMQ -> http://localhost:15672/** guest-guest
* **Web UI "cube_bidsignalr" -> http://localhost:9008/**
* **Web UI "cube_bidapi" -> http://localhost:8008/swagger/index.html**
* **Web UI "cube_auctionapi" -> http://localhost:8007/swagger/index.html**

4. Microservides need to run in background:
* **mongo**
